== Kauperts::MysqlSlaveChecker

<b>Kauperts::MysqlSlaveChecker</b> is a simple abstraction to access the output of 
MySQL's `SHOW SLAVE STATUSÂ´ in Ruby.

It translates all column names found in the status output to downcased/underscore'd 
Ruby methods on the instance.

It is nothing but a quick hackdown and doesn't even come with tests. It's currently
used as a standalone command line tool with performed actions based on their status
at the bottom of the file.

=== Usage
	MYSQL_USERNAME=le_slave MYSQL_PASSWORD=foo MYSQL_SOCKET=/var/run/mysql.sock ./mysql_slave_checker.rb

=== Requirements
The class depends on the +mysql+ and +activesupport+ gems.

=== .plan
* Add tests
* Make this a gem
